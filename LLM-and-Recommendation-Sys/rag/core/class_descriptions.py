SKIN_CONDITION_PROFILES = {
    "Oily Skin": """
Oily skin is defined by excess sebum production from overactive sebaceous glands, leading to a shiny, slick, or greasy appearance, particularly in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin).

Key Concerns & Skincare Goals:
The primary concerns are visible shine, enlarged or clogged pores, and a higher tendency for blackheads, whiteheads, and acne breakouts. This often results in an uneven or bumpy skin texture. The main goals are to regulate and control excess oil production, clear and prevent congestion, and provide lightweight, non-greasy hydration to maintain a healthy skin barrier without triggering rebound oiliness.

Beneficial Ingredients & Functions:

Salicylic Acid (BHA): Oil-soluble, it penetrates pores to dissolve sebum and exfoliate from within, effectively clearing blackheads and preventing clogged follicles.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃): Helps regulate sebum synthesis, strengthens the skin barrier, reduces inflammation and redness, and visibly minimizes the appearance of large pores over time.

Clay (Kaolin or Bentonite): Absorbs excess surface oil and impurities, providing a temporary mattifying effect and reducing congestion.

Retinoids (Retinol, Adapalene): Increase cell turnover to prevent pores from plugging and help regulate the activity of oil glands for long-term control.

Lightweight Hydrators (Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin): Provide essential water-based hydration, signaling to the skin that it does not need to overproduce oil to compensate for dryness.

Ideal Product Attributes & Textures:
Formulations should be lightweight, oil-free, water-based, and explicitly labeled "non-comedogenic" to ensure they do not clog pores. Ideal product textures include gentle gel cleansers, foaming cleansers, thin water-based serums, and oil-free gel or gel-cream moisturizers that absorb quickly without leaving a heavy or greasy residue.

""",  # End of Eye Bags description
    "Acne": """
Acne is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by clogged pores (comedones), excess sebum production, and bacterial overgrowth. This results in various lesions, including blackheads, whiteheads, red bumps (papules), and pus-filled pustules, often leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark spots) and scarring.

Key Characteristics & Skincare Goals:
The primary concerns are active breakouts, clogged pores, inflammation, and managing an oily or greasy skin texture. Skincare goals focus on unclogging pores, regulating excess oil, reducing the bacteria that contribute to acne, calming inflammation, and preventing future lesions. A key objective is also to minimize long-term issues like dark spots and scarring by promoting gentle healing.

Beneficial Ingredients & Functions:

Salicylic Acid (BHA): An oil-soluble exfoliant that penetrates deep into pores to dissolve sebum and dead skin cells, making it highly effective for clearing blackheads and whiteheads.

Benzoyl Peroxide: A powerful antimicrobial agent that directly kills the C. acnes bacteria responsible for inflammatory acne, thereby reducing red, painful pustules.

Topical Retinoids (Adapalene, Retinol): Considered a cornerstone of acne treatment, they normalize skin cell turnover to prevent pores from clogging in the first place and have significant anti-inflammatory properties.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃): Helps regulate sebum production to control oiliness, strengthens the skin barrier to reduce irritation from other treatments, and calms redness.

Azelaic Acid: An effective anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredient that treats active acne lesions while also helping to fade the post-inflammatory dark spots they leave behind.

Alpha-Hydroxy Acids (AHAs like Glycolic Acid): Exfoliate the skin's surface to improve texture, prevent superficial pore blockages, and help clear post-acne marks.

Ideal Product Attributes & Textures:
Products for acne-prone skin must be labeled "non-comedogenic" and are typically oil-free to avoid contributing to clogged pores. Ideal formulations include gentle gel or foam cleansers, lightweight serums containing targeted actives, and oil-free, hydrating moisturizers with ceramides to support the skin barrier without causing greasiness. Daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is essential to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from darkening.
    """,
    
    "Dry Skin": """
Dry skin is a skin type characterized by a lack of sufficient lipids (like ceramides) and moisture, leading to a compromised skin barrier. This results in feelings of tightness, a rough or flaky texture, and a dull, lackluster appearance. Fine lines may also appear more pronounced due to dehydration.

Key Characteristics & Skincare Goals:
The primary concerns are restoring the skin's protective barrier, deeply replenishing moisture, and preventing water loss (TEWL). Skincare goals focus on supplying essential lipids to repair the barrier, using humectants to draw in hydration, and applying occlusives to seal that moisture in. The overall objective is to soothe tightness and irritation, smooth rough texture, and achieve a comfortable, supple, and hydrated complexion.

Beneficial Ingredients & Functions:

Ceramides, Cholesterol, and Fatty Acids: These are barrier-repairing emollients that are critical for rebuilding the skin's structure, reducing roughness, and preventing moisture from escaping.

Humectants (Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Urea): These ingredients attract and bind water to the skin's surface, providing an immediate boost of hydration and helping to plump fine lines.

Occlusives (Petrolatum, Squalane, Shea Butter): These form a protective seal over the skin to lock in hydration and prevent transepidermal water loss, effectively protecting against environmental dryness.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃): Supports the skin's natural production of ceramides, strengthening the barrier from within and improving moisture retention over time.

Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B₅): A soothing and hydrating ingredient that helps calm the itching and irritation often associated with dry, compromised skin.

Ideal Product Attributes & Textures:
Products for dry skin should be gentle, nourishing, and supportive of the skin barrier. Ideal formulations are typically fragrance-free and include creamy, non-foaming, or milky cleansers that don't strip natural oils. Effective products often come as rich creams, thick balms, or nourishing facial oils that provide a lasting layer of moisture and protection. Layering a hydrating serum under a ceramide-rich moisturizer is a highly effective strategy.
    """,
    
    "Combination Skin": """
Combination skin is a mixed skin type featuring both oily and dry or normal areas on the face. It is most commonly characterized by an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) with visible shine and enlarged pores, alongside drier or more balanced cheeks and jawline that may feel tight or show flakiness.

Key Characteristics & Skincare Goals:
The primary concern is the dual challenge of managing excess sebum and congestion in the T-zone while simultaneously hydrating and supporting the barrier in the drier zones. Skincare goals are centered on balancing the skin: regulating oil and minimizing pores in oily areas, and providing targeted hydration to dry patches. The overall objective is to achieve a unified, comfortable complexion without causing breakouts in the T-zone or stripping the cheeks.

Beneficial Ingredients & Functions:

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃): An ideal balancing ingredient that helps regulate sebum production in the T-zone while also strengthening the skin barrier and improving hydration in drier areas.

Salicylic Acid (BHA): An oil-soluble exfoliant perfect for targeting the T-zone. It penetrates pores to dissolve oil and debris, effectively clearing blackheads and preventing congestion where it's most needed.

Lightweight Hydrators (Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin): Provide essential, water-based moisture that benefits both zones. They hydrate the dry areas without adding heavy oils that could overwhelm the T-zone.

Ceramides: Crucial for reinforcing the skin barrier. They are especially beneficial for the drier cheek areas to prevent moisture loss and reduce tightness.

Clay (Kaolin or Bentonite): Excellent for use as a targeted mask on the T-zone to absorb excess oil and purify pores without affecting the drier parts of the face.

Ideal Product Attributes & Textures:
Managing combination skin often requires a multi-textural approach. A gentle gel or light foam cleanser works well for the entire face. For targeted treatment, lightweight serums or gel-based, oil-free moisturizers are ideal for the T-zone to provide hydration without shine. For the drier cheek areas, richer but still non-comedogenic creams containing ceramides are more suitable. Sunscreens should be lightweight and non-greasy to avoid congesting the T-zone.
    """,
    
    "Sensitive Skin": """
Sensitive skin is a condition defined by heightened reactivity to products and environmental factors, often resulting from a compromised or weakened skin barrier. It commonly manifests as visible redness, flushing, or uncomfortable sensations like stinging, burning, or itching.

Key Characteristics & Skincare Goals:
The primary concerns are reducing irritation, calming visible redness and inflammation, and alleviating feelings of discomfort. Skincare goals are centered on restoring and reinforcing the skin's protective barrier to prevent irritants from penetrating and to lock in moisture. The overall objective is to build skin resilience, minimize reactivity, and maintain a calm, comfortable, and hydrated state.

Beneficial Ingredients & Functions:

Ceramides, Cholesterol, and Fatty Acids: The fundamental building blocks for repairing a compromised skin barrier. They replenish essential lipids, reduce water loss, and decrease skin's permeability to external irritants.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃): A versatile soothing agent that strengthens the skin barrier by promoting ceramide production and provides powerful anti-inflammatory benefits to visibly reduce redness.

Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B₅) & Allantoin: Highly effective soothing and healing ingredients that help calm irritation, reduce itching, and support the skin's natural repair processes.

Centella Asiatica (Cica) & Madecassoside: Renowned for their calming and restorative properties, they are excellent for soothing redness and comforting irritated, reactive skin.

Squalane: A lightweight, skin-mimicking emollient that provides gentle hydration and barrier support without feeling heavy or greasy.

Colloidal Oatmeal & Bisabolol: Anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant agents that are exceptional at relieving itching and calming distressed skin.

Ideal Product Attributes & Textures:
Products for sensitive skin must be gentle, soothing, and minimalist. Formulations should always be fragrance-free and hypoallergenic. Ideal textures include milky or creamy cleansers, calming hydrating serums, and rich but non-irritating barrier-repair moisturizers. A physical (mineral) sunscreen with Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide is essential for daily protection, as it is far less likely to cause irritation than chemical sunscreens.
    """,
    "Pigmentation":"""
Pigmentation refers to areas of skin that have become darker or uneven in tone due to excess melanin (the pigment produced by melanocytes). It can present as small spots (freckles), larger patches (lentigines or melasma), or a general dullness from post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Common underlying causes include:

Ultraviolet (UV) Exposure: UV radiation stimulates melanocytes to produce more melanin as a protective response, leading to sun spots or solar lentigines.

Hormonal Fluctuations: Estrogen and progesterone can increase melanin synthesis, often causing melasma (“mask of pregnancy”) in women.

Inflammation or Injury: Acne lesions, eczema, insect bites, or minor trauma can trigger excess melanin production during healing, resulting in PIH.

Genetics & Ethnicity: Individuals with darker Fitzpatrick skin types have more active melanocytes and are more prone to visible hyperpigmentation.

Aging: Over years of sun exposure, melanocyte clusters grow unevenly, causing age spots.

Key Characteristics & Concerns

Localized Dark Spots: Small, well-defined patches (freckles, lentigines) that do not tan away and tend to enlarge or darken with sun exposure.

Diffuse or Patterned Patches: Melasma often appears symmetrically on cheeks, forehead, or upper lip as brownish-gray patches.

Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH): Flat, brownish or reddish dark marks left behind after acne, eczema, or other inflammatory processes.

Uneven Overall Tone: Skin may look patchy or dull if multiple types of pigmentation coexist.

Texture Variations: Heavily pigmented areas can feel slightly different (rougher or raised) if accompanied by solar damage or thickened skin.

Self-Esteem Impact: Visible dark spots or patches can lead to frustration or decreased confidence, motivating individuals to seek corrective measures.

Skincare Needs & Goals
To address pigmentation, the focus is on inhibiting excess melanin production, promoting gentle exfoliation of pigmented cells, and protecting against further UV‐induced darkening. Core goals include:

Inhibiting Melanin Synthesis: Downregulate tyrosinase (the key enzyme in melanin production) so fewer pigment granules form.

Accelerating Cell Turnover & Exfoliation: Help shed pigmented keratinocytes more quickly, revealing a more even tone.

Preventing New Pigmentation: Use broad-spectrum sun protection and barrier-strengthening to block UV‐induced melanogenesis.

Soothing & Repairing Barrier: Minimize irritation that could trigger more PIH, especially on darker skin.

Brightening & Evening Tone: Improve overall radiance by hydrating and nourishing the skin.

Beneficial Product Attributes & Ingredients

Broad‐Spectrum Sunscreen (SPF 30+ Physical or Gentle Chemical)

Function: Blocks UVA/UVB rays that trigger melanocyte activation and darkening of existing spots.

Effect: Prevents new hyperpigmentation and stops dark spots from deepening.

Tip: Reapply every two hours when outdoors; use a “sheer” or tinted formula to encourage consistent use.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B₃, 2–5%)

Function: Inhibits transfer of melanosomes (pigment granules) from melanocytes to keratinocytes, and supports barrier lipids.

Effect: Gradually lightens existing dark spots, evens overall tone, and strengthens barrier to reduce PIH risk.

Tip: Layer under moisturizer once or twice daily; well-tolerated by most skin types.

Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, or Ascorbyl Glucoside)

Function: Potent antioxidant that inhibits tyrosinase activity, promotes collagen, and neutralizes free radicals.

Effect: Brightens dark spots, fades melasma over time, and prevents UV‐induced melanin formation.

Tip: Use in the morning under sunscreen; choose stable, pH-appropriate formulations (L-ascorbic acid around pH 3.5; MAP/AG around pH 6–7 for sensitive skin).

Azelaic Acid (10–15%)

Function: Inhibits tyrosinase, reduces inflammation, and gently exfoliates the follicular lining.

Effect: Improves PIH, melasma, and redness associated with blemishes.

Tip: Apply twice daily on clean skin; mild tingling may occur initially but usually subsides.

Alpha-Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid 5–10%)

Function: Chemical exfoliants that loosen intercellular “glue,” accelerating shedding of pigmented keratinocytes.

Effect: Reduces surface discoloration, improves texture, and enhances penetration of other brightening actives.

Tip: Use 1–2 times per week (8–10% glycolic or 5–8% lactic) to avoid over‐exfoliation; follow with a hydrating layer.

Beta-Hydroxy Acid (Salicylic Acid 1–2%)

Function: Oil-soluble exfoliant that clears congested pores and removes superficial pigment in acne-prone areas.

Effect: Helps fade PIH from acne lesions and prevents new post‐inflammatory spots from forming.

Tip: Apply as a leave-on serum or toner on affected zones; avoid using on very dry patches.

Kojic Acid (1%–2%)

Function: Chelates copper at the tyrosinase active site, reducing melanin synthesis.

Effect: Lightens stubborn dark spots and ethanol-extracted sun spots with consistent use.

Tip: Use in combination with other brighteners (e.g., vitamin C); may increase sensitivity, so introduce gradually.

Licorice Root Extract (5%–10% Glabridin or Licochalcone A)

Function: Contains glabridin which inhibits tyrosinase, and licochalcone A which soothes inflammation.

Effect: Reduces PIH and melasma while calming redness.

Tip: Often found in serums or toners; suitable for sensitive or darker skin types prone to PIH.

Tranexamic Acid (2%–5%)

Function: Inhibits plasmin activity in keratinocytes, indirectly reducing UV-induced prostaglandin-mediated melanocyte activation.

Effect: Effective for melasma and recalcitrant hyperpigmentation.

Tip: Use once or twice daily; combine with sunscreen and barrier-supporting ingredients to maximize results.

Retinoids (Retinol 0.25–0.5%, Adapalene 0.1%)

Function: Increase cell turnover and normalize keratinocyte differentiation, dispersing existing pigment and preventing new accumulation.

Effect: Gradually fades dark spots and improves overall texture; also protects against photoaging.

Tip: Start by applying 1–2 times per week at night, gradually increasing frequency; always follow with moisturizer to minimize irritation.

Niacinamide + Peptide/Retinol Combinations

Function: Niacinamide stabilizes and calms while retinol or peptides boost turnover and collagen.

Effect: Addresses both pigment and skin firmness, reducing the depth of sunspots over months.

Tip: Use in alternating layers: niacinamide serum → retinol → moisturizer, to minimize retinol-induced dryness.

Shea Butter or Ceramide-Rich Moisturizers

Function: Reinforce the lipid barrier to prevent irritation that can trigger PIH.

Effect: Provides hydration, smooths textured pigmented areas, and supports overall barrier health.

Tip: Apply as the final hydrating layer, especially if using chemical exfoliants or vitamin C, to calm any potential stinging.

Behaviors & Ingredients to Approach with Caution or Avoid

Excessive Sun Exposure Without Protection: UV light deepens existing pigmentation and causes new spots.

Picking, Scrubbing, or Forcing Extractions: Trauma to the skin increases inflammation, leading to more PIH—especially in darker skin types.

Harsh Physical Exfoliants (Loofahs, Rough Scrubs): Can cause micro-tears and inflammation, worsening PIH.

High-Concentration Acids Used Too Frequently (Glycolic ≥15%, Salicylic ≥2%): Over‐exfoliation disrupts barrier and can paradoxically induce more pigmentation.

Skipping Moisturizer After Exfoliation: Leaves barrier compromised, heightening inflammation and risk of new pigment formation.

Fragrance & Essential Oils (Limonene, Lavender Oil): Potential irritants and sensitizers that can trigger PIH through low‐grade inflammation.

Not Wearing Sunscreen Under Photosensitizing Actives (Retinoids, AHAs): These ingredients increase UV sensitivity; without SPF, pigmented areas can darken rapidly.

Overuse of Hydroquinone (>2% OTC or Unsupervised Use): Long‐term or high‐strength use risks ochronosis (blue-gray tanning) and rebound hyperpigmentation.

Ignoring Consistency & Patience: Most brightening regimens require 8–12 weeks to show noticeable improvement; abrupt discontinuation can lead to relapse.

By combining diligent sun protection, tyrosinase‐inhibiting actives (niacinamide, vitamin C, azelaic acid, or kojic acid), gentle exfoliation, and barrier‐supporting moisturization—while strictly avoiding irritants—you can gradually fade existing pigmentation, prevent new dark spots, and achieve a more even, radiant complexion.
